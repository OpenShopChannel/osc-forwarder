The forwarder channel for the Open Shop Channel.

---

_This forwarder is based on code provided by GBAtemp user [FIX94](https://gbatemp.net/members/fix94.232444/). FIX94 posted [a thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/forwarder-with-meta-xml-support.273165/) in which they provided the source code for their Configurable USB Loader forwarder channel. Thank you, FIX94!_

This application attempts to load and execute `/apps/oscdownload/boot.dol` from the SD card on the user's Wii system. Because this application only loads and executes another application, it is known as a forwarder.

This application is meant to be installed as a [hidden channel](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Title_database#00010008:_.22Hidden.22_channels), and should be packaged as a [WAD](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/WAD_files). If installed correctly, the channel will take up about 1 megabyte of the system NAND, and will not occupy a channel slot in the System Menu.
